   <p  style="font-size:20px;" >The rapid development of modern science and technology gives birth to artificial intelligence technology. As a new technology, artificial intelligence technology has been fully used in various fields of social development. Artificial intelligence technology is the result of the integration of computer technology and other disciplines. The root is that artificial intelligence technology is an intelligent tool based on human intelligence simulation, which replaces human beings for complex work. Analyzing the development process and results of AI technology at home and abroad, we can find that at present, the research of AI technology mainly focuses on expert system and robot system.The precision and complexity of human brain itself has become the biggest obstacle to the development of artificial intelligence technology, because artificial intelligence technology mainly simulates human brain to complete its work, but early simulation is difficult to achieve good results, but with the development of modern science and technology, these problems are increasingly overcome, and this simulation becomes possible. In addition, the artificial intelligence technology embedded in the simulation environment can greatly reduce human consumption, and improve the simulation accuracy and automation. One fact needs to be clear is that the application of artificial intelligence technology has become a trend, but it does not show that the current artificial intelligence technology has matured. In other words, artificial intelligence technology is still in the development stage, there are still some problems that need to be improved and optimized.</p>
